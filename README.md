The model used for this project was purchased from <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1596579158/br55-cannon-halo-printable-3d-model-stl?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=halo+br55&ref=sr_gallery-1-1&dd=1&content_source=9b0ec927c30374885e1954304b22e7a859dce2e9%253A1596579158&search_preloaded_img=1&organic_search_click=1">this link.</a>

It took approximately 2 weeks to print all of the files on my ender 3 v2. Some of the pieces did warp while printing. I would suggest printing all of the pieces with a raft. You'll want to orient the prints so that they require as little support material as possible. 

My recommended print settings 
* 0.2mm layer height
* 20% infill

Print part 76_Body_Dark Gray with
*0.2mm layer height
* 0% Infill
* 2.0mm wall thickness
* 1.6mm top/bottom thickness
* Supports: Raft (everywhere)

Specific print advice:
(coming soon)

```bash

```
